"""In-memory aggregated state for the SE3 central server.

:class:`ServerState` holds the live picture of every SE3 machine whose daemon
has dialed in: the machine's identity, connection liveness, and the set of
flows it is running. It is the server-side mirror of the per-machine snapshots
that daemons push as ``STATUS_UPDATE`` messages.

The store is intentionally **not persisted** — this delivery deliberately
scopes out a database. All state lives in process memory and is rebuilt as
daemons reconnect and re-push their snapshots. Access is guarded by an
``asyncio.Lock`` so the WebSocket handler and the REST handlers (all running
on the same event loop) never observe a half-applied update.
